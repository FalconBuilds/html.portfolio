    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I go by Falcon Builds on the internet, but I found a interest in coding
    after the Covid-19 pandemic. After much research into the various method
    of learning coding, I settled on the Udemy Complete Web Developement
    Bootcamp 2023. In my spare time I dive into the words of Pokemon and Zelda
    to help escape from the modern world, I am also exploring how to design
    and code my own game. I have recently adopted a chocolate labrador who
    claims to go by Benji! I hope to further my knowledge of the coding
    datascape and get my career started!</p>
